# For the deployment code below to work, you need to first carry out the following steps on your local machine:
# 1.  Create a Meteor developer account and sign-up for Galaxy
# 2a. Login with Meteor and save the session to file
#     METEOR_SESSION_FILE=meteor-session-file.json meteor login
# 2b. Use Node.js to encode and output the file as a Base64 string
#     FILE_CONTENT=`cat meteor-session-file.json` node -e "console.log(new Buffer(process.env.FILE_CONTENT).toString('base64'))"
# 3.  Copy & paste the output in an environment variable called METEOR_SESSION_FILE_CONTENT in the project settings on CircleCI
