      # Running Chimp with an empty directory for path means it will not run any tests. This allows us to run Chimp
      # quickly and download runtime dependencies so they can be cached.

    # Cache Karma's dependencies
      # The karma.options.js file defines a basePath of '.' and a test path of `src`, and since the config file is in
      # ./config, it means karma will look for tests under ./config/src where there is a simple test file. This allows
      # us to run Karma quickly and download runtime dependencies so they can be cached

# For the deployment code below to work, you need to first carry out the following steps:
# 1. Create a Meteor developer account and sign-up for Galaxy
# 2. Execute these commands on your local machine:
#    METEOR_SESSION_FILE=meteor-session-file.json meteor login
#    FILE_CONTENT=`cat meteor-session-file.json` node -e "console.log(new Buffer(process.env.FILE_CONTENT).toString('base64'))"
# 3. Store the output in an environment variable called METEOR_SESSION_FILE_CONTENT in CircleCI

deployment:
  # We deploy to production any time the previous test step passed AND...
  production:
   # ...when the commit is made to this branch
   branch: dev
   commands:
     # Use Node.js to decode and output the Base64 environment variable called METEOR_SESSION_FILE, then redirect the output to a file called meteor-session-file.json
   - node -e "console.log(new Buffer(process.env.METEOR_SESSION_FILE_CONTENT, 'Base64').toString('utf-8'))" > src/meteor-session-file.json
     # Next we tell Meteor deploy to use the session file, to deploy to app.qualityfaster.com and to use the production-settings.json
   - DEPLOY_HOSTNAME=galaxy.meteor.com METEOR_SESSION_FILE=meteor-session-file.json meteor deploy qualityfaster:
       pwd: src
